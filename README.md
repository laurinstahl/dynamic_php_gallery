Dynamic PHP Gallery

I have written this gallery to be used in a simple CMS for a small website.

Because I have spent a lot of time searching for a good gallery prior to writing it myself, I decided to upload it here.

I have stripped the files of almost any css and html and tried to make it as simple as possible so anyone could easily implement it.

As of writing this, there is neither an install file nor a SQL file but I will follow up with that shortly.
Also I will try to translate everything in basic english as soon as possible - the code for the gallery can get a little bit confusing without any comments, which are in German.
